build an interactive app for voting and ranking the best  natural parks.

The app should allow users to vote on parks head to head, then calculate a ranking for the parks based on the chest ELO system.

The app should permanently display and match up along the overall rankings and recent votes.

## Tech Stack
- JS  runtime: node.js
- package manager: pnpm
- command: use `pnpm` instead of `npm`
- JS development frameworks: next.js and react
- tailwind v4 - !careful with setting it up, use context7 to read latest docs!
- SQLite


## Data
- Use data from file 'plan_park_voting_next.md' which has the images for the parks extracted from wikipedia page https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_national_parks_of_the_United_States

## Development Rules
- Use context7 mcp to get the latest next.js and react docs
- use playwrite mcp to test front end
